# MoodCube Lift Off Hinges

![](Images/lift_off_hinges.png)

 Lift off hinges for DoomCube and other 20 base extrusion framed printers.  Each hinge uses two printed halves, and a 5mm pin 60-65mm long.  Seating the pin in the lower half may require help with a hammer.  The top half should slide on and off with little effort.  Both these fits are intentional.  Print upright.  Designed for ABS.

Take note there are both left and right hand hinges.  This allows you to choose which way your door swings.  Choose the hinge type that's right for the swing you want, and print 2 of them.
